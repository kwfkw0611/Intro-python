    "In particular Python has brilliant libraries for data science and machine learning, and is currently the most popular language used in these fields. Its popularity and open source means debugging is considerably easier and faster, since any problem you have encountered, it is likely to be already posted on stackoverflow (a popular programming forum). A recent [post](https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/09/06/incredible-growth-python/) from stackoverflow predicts its popularity to keep growing.\n",

This makes Python well suited for data analysis as we can easily use code to explore our problem, and get instant feedback. The same instant feed back loop makes it easier for a beginner to learn since they can quickly see the output of their code. It also aids in incremental development workflows, like that of programming in Jupyter notebooks."
